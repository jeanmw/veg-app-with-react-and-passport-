# Passport Auth with React

### Why is this important?

We already know how to do auth with MEN stack apps, but we want to have options of doing auth if we use a framework as well. Because React scripts run on a separate server from the backend, we need to identify what changes should be made to use Passport with React.

### What are the Objectives:

* See how we adjust our usual Passport auth implementation for a React app
* identify the steps needed to use Passport with React

### Where should we be now?

* Should already have implemented simple auth and/or Passport auth with a MEN stack app
* Should have a good understanding of hashing and salting as it relates to passwords and auth
* Should be able to successfully build a basic React app
